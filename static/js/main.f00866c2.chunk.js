The occasion was a regular class I usually do in the city. It\'s called Gaga. You don\'t need to be a dancer to do Gaga. You really just have to be a human of any age. What I love about it is that it\'s about moving for pleasure. There\u2019s no right or wrong way to feel your skin moving through the air or noticing gravity pulling on your bones. It is very exploratory and liberating practice, and a lot of fun. What I love about the in person experience is that you\u2019re in a room with about 20 people, many strangers, just exploring movement in a curious and gentle way. Since we can\u2019t go to class, the teachers in New York and Tel Aviv (where Gaga is from) have been hosting online classes to support all the freelance dancers who currently are out of work. It is one of my favorite things to do in the city, and I\'m so happy that people all over the world can now join in. While the dynamism, and some of the poetry, is lost in the online setting it is truly incredible to \u201cdance\u201d with hundreds of people from New York and Israel to Brazil, New Zealand and France. All over. It\'s amazing, amazing!","Plants. I\'ve been sprouting seeds for my garden and it\'s truly miraculous to see these tiny little dudes push through the dark soil and into the light. I am reminded of life\'s courage, its persistence, its adaptability. But mostly, I am reminded that life chases light, life comes from darkness and hard as it is to accept (life is so sweet, so precious!) to darkness it returns. Watching other things move and grow temporarily releases me from the grand human narrative, and I am reminded of the very many lives/experiences unfolding in our shared home that we call earth.","My husband, Alex. I feel extraordinarily fortunate to be sharing even more of my time and space with someone I truly love and adore, who makes me laugh, and who approaches life with a light and even touch. I realize too that it is this kind of love of others, and the loss of such love, that fills us with fear, anxiety and regret. So I am really taking my time to enjoy Alex\'s laughter and to savor his presence and touch. Living in this way is magnetizing and it starts to touch other things too. Like really noticing the way water moves over your body in the shower, how it sounds and actually feels, how different the 7th or 15th almond or potato chip in your mouth actually can taste, and what that far away friend\'s face is really saying beneath courageous words. Our reverence and care can extend into all corners of our world. It can touch every part of our lives. And while it won\'t change sadness or loss when it comes, hopefully we\'ll feel a little less regret having been present for our life. We are all beneficiaries of chance, and I\'m grateful for the chance to practice living with a vivid appreciation of how brief and precious life is."]],["Sydra M",["The sun.
